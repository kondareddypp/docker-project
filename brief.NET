Set up your Azure DevOps pipeline using the azure-pipelines.yml file.

Here's a brief rundown of what each section does:

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build-env: Uses the .NET SDK image for building the application.

COPY *.csproj ./ and RUN dotnet restore: Copies the project file and restores dependencies.

COPY . ./ and RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out: Copies the remaining files and builds the app.

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0: Uses the ASP.NET runtime image to run the application.

COPY --from=build-env /app/out .: Copies the built app from the build environment.

The azure-pipelines.yml file defines an Azure DevOps pipeline that:

Triggers on changes to the main branch.

Builds the .NET Core project.

Builds and pushes a Docker image to your container registry.
