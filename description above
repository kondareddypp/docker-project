This basic Dockerfile does the following:

Uses the official Python 3.9 slim image as the base.

Sets the working directory in the container to /usr/src/app.

Copies all files from your project directory into the container.

Optionally installs Python dependencies (commented out in this example).

Specifies the command to run (app.py) when the container starts.
